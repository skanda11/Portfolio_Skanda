## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (which includes npm) installed on your machine. Version 16.x or higher is recommended.

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository (or create a new project):**
    If you have cloned this repository, just run `npm install`. If you are starting from scratch, first create a new React project using Vite:
    ```bash
    npm create vite@latest skanda-portfolio -- --template react
    cd skanda-portfolio
    ```

2.  **Install Tailwind CSS:**
    Follow the official guide to install Tailwind CSS for Vite: [Install Tailwind CSS with Vite](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/vite). The main steps are:
    ```bash
    npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
    npx tailwindcss init -p
    ```

3.  **Configure Tailwind:**
    Update your `tailwind.config.js` to include the paths to all of your template files:
    ```js
    /** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
    export default {
      content: [
        "./index.html",
        "./src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
      ],
      theme: {
        extend: {},
      },
      plugins: [],
    }
    ```

4.  **Add Tailwind directives to your CSS:**
    Add the `@tailwind` directives for each of Tailwindâ€™s layers to your main `./src/index.css` file.
    ```css
    @tailwind base;
    @tailwind components;
    @tailwind utilities;
    ```

5.  **Replace the code:**
    Copy the code from `App.jsx` in this repository into your `./src/App.jsx` file.

6.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) (or whatever port is shown) to view it in your browser.

## Deployment

This app is ready to be deployed on any static site hosting service. My recommendations are:

- **Vercel:** Optimized for performance and very easy to use.
- **Netlify:** Excellent user interface and powerful features.

To deploy, simply connect your GitHub repository to one of these services and follow their on-screen instructions. The build command is `npm run build` and the publish directory is `dist`.
